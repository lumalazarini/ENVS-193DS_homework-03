Homework 3 for 193DS 

## General information

This repo is for completing Homework 3 for ENVS 193DS

## Data and file information

The data folder includes a file called screen_time.csv, which contains personal screen time and class time data used for Problem 1.

The code folder contains R scripts used for the project. The code groups screen time data by class time group (High Class Time, Low Class Time) and calculates the mean screen time for each group, excluding zero values in the mean calculation.

A boxplot is created to using ggplot2 to compare average screen time between the two groups, with jitter points added to visualize individual data points.

A summary table is created using the gt package. This table displays the mean screen time for each class time group, formatted with titles and labels.

Any images used in the rendered output are stored in the main project folder (ENVS-193DS_homework-03)
