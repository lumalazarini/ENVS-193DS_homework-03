# 1. Personal data

## a. Data Summarizing

I could calculate the mean screen time in minutes to compare my average screen time with the average minutes I spent in class. In days that I spent greater time in class, I would expect to have a lower screen time.

## b.

```{r}
#reading in my data
screen_time <- read_csv(Users/lumabraconi/Documents/ENVS-193DS/ENVS-193DS_homework-03/data/screen_time.csv)

```

```{r}
#create a category based on class time
data <- data %>%
  mutate(class_time_group = ifelse(`Minutes of class` > median(`Minutes of class`, na.rm = TRUE),
                                   "High Class Time", "Low Class Time"))

```

```{r}
#creating visualization
ggplot(data= HW 1 ENVS 193DS - Screen time.csv, 
       aes(x = class_time_group, 
           y = `Screen time (min)`, 
           fill = class_time_group)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, 
              alpha = 0.6, 
              color = "black") +  # individual data points
  stat_summary(fun = mean, 
               geom = "crossbar", 
               width = 0.5,
               color = "darkred", 
               fatten = 2, 
               show.legend = FALSE) +  # mean bars
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("High Class Time" = "#2E86AB", 
                               "Low Class Time" = "#F18F01")) +
  labs(
    title = "Average Screen Time by Class Time Group",
    x = "Class Time Group",
    y = "Screen Time (minutes)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```

```{r}
#Same as HW2
ggplot(data= screen_time, #get data from glaciers file
       aes(x= minutes_of_class,#x-axis is the time in class
           y= screen_time_min))+ #y-axis is the screen time
  geom_point(color= "skyblue")+ #make dots blue
  labs(x= "Time in Class (min)",
       y= "Screen Time (min)") #relabel for aesthetics
```

# 2. Affective visualization

## a.

A form of affective data visualization I can use to depict my personal data would be to draw out my weekly school schedule, showing my classes from Monday through Friday. Mixed into this schedule, I would include a graph of my screen time data for each day of the week. This would allow the viewer to easily see if having more class time actually reduces my screen time or if it doesn't really make a difference. The goal would be to create an engaging and visually clear piece that tells the story at a quick glance.

## b.

```{r}

```

## c.

## d.

My piece shows a graph of my data for each day of the week, color-coded and layered with my school schedule. I was inspired by Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec's Dear Data project, where they visualized personal data in creative and meaningful ways. I liked how their work made the data both informative and visually engaging. The form of my work is a hand-drawn piece using pencil and watercolor, with watercolor used for the bar columns. I created my piece by first drawing the data bars, then layering my weekly class schedule over them to show the relationship between screen time and time spent in class.

# 3.

## a.

This paper utilizes linear regression as the statistical test.

```{r}

```

## b.

The authors visually represented their statistics very clearly. The linear regression model attached displays the proper response and predictor variables on the y- and x-axes, respectively. The figure shows summary statistics by providing the line of best fit along with the individual data points and a 95% confidence interval shaded around the line, which helps show the model’s uncertainty while still letting the reader see the raw data.

## c.

The authors handled visual clutter well. The individual dots as data points are small but still easy to see. The line of best fit is a good thickness (not too bold) and the 95% confidence interval is a transparent grey that blends well with the background, so it doesn’t overwhelm the reader or distract from the actual data.

## d.

One recommendation I would make is to change the background color of the plot from grey to white to make the data points and confidence interval stand out more. I would also consider changing the color of the regression line to red other than blue to make it more visible and contrast better with the dots. Lastly, I would increase the size of the axis labels slightly and bold them so they’re easier to read. These changes would make the figure easier to understand at a quick glance.
