# 1. Set up

```{r libraries-and-data}
library(tidyverse) # general use
library(janitor) # cleaning data frames
library(here) # file/folder organization
library(ggeffects) # generating model predictions
library(gtsummary) # generating summary tables for models
library(gt)

```

# 1. Personal data

## a. Data Summarizing

I could calculate class time between high and low categories by finding the mean of my class time added. I can then create a boxplot to compare this with my screen time. In days that I spent greater time in class, I would expect to have a lower screen time because I am more busy.

## b. Visualization

```{r}
#reading in my data
screen_time <- read_csv(here("data", "screen_time.csv"))
```

```{r}
#create a category based on class time
data <- screen_time |> #get data from screen_time file
  mutate(class_time_group = ifelse #add a new column called class_time_group
         (`Minutes of class` > mean #when minutes of class is greater than the mean, classify as high class time
           (`Minutes of class` [`Minutes of class` > 0], na.rm = TRUE), #exclude zeros and NA's
                                   "High Class Time", "Low Class Time")) #if condition if true, label as high class time. If false, label as low class time
```

```{r}
#creating visualization
ggplot(data= data, #get data from data file
       aes(x = class_time_group, #x is class time group (high or low)
           y = `Screen time (min)`, #y is screen time
           fill = class_time_group)) + # fill color based on class time group
  geom_boxplot() +  # Show boxplot without default outliers
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.6, color = "blue") +  # Add individual points
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("High Class Time" = "#2E86AB", # blue for high class time
                               "Low Class Time" = "#F18F01")) + #orange for low class time 
  labs(
    title = "Average Screen Time by Class Time Group", #Plot title
    x = "Class Time", #x-axis label
    y = "Screen Time (minutes)", #y-axis label
    fill = "Class Time Group" # legend title
  ) +
  theme_classic() #minimal theme

```

## c. Caption

Figure \_\_. Boxplot illustrating screen time (in minutes) categorized by class time groups. Contrary to the original hypothesis, days with higher class time correspond to slightly increased screen time. The lower class time group includes more data points and exhibits a wider range of values. In the plot, box edges indicate the interquartile range (IQR), the line within each box represents the median, and whiskers extend to the most extreme values excluding outliers. Outliers are shown as black dots.

## d. Table presentation

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Create a summary table
gt_table <- data |> 
  group_by(class_time_group) |> 
  
# Summarize mean screen time
  summarise(mean_screen_time = mean(`Screen time (min)`[`Screen time (min)` > 0], na.rm = TRUE)) |> #Calculate the mean screen time for each group 
  mutate(mean_screen_time = round(mean_screen_time, 1)) #Round the mean values to one decimal place

# Create a gt table
gt_table |> 
  gt() |> 
  
# Add the titles and labels
  tab_header(
    title = "Average Screen Time by Class Time Group"
  ) |> 
  cols_label(
    class_time_group = "Class Time Group",
    mean_screen_time = "Mean Screen Time (minutes)"
  )
```
# 2. Affective visualization

## a. Describe in words what an affective visualization could look like for your personal data

A form of affective data visualization I can use to depict my personal data would be to draw out my weekly school schedule, showing my classes from Monday through Friday. Mixed into this schedule, I would include a graph of my screen time data for each day of the week. This would allow the viewer to easily see if having more class time actually reduces my screen time or if it doesn't really make a difference. The goal would be to create an engaging and visually clear piece that tells the story at a quick glance.

## b. Create a sketch (on paper) of your idea

## c. Make a draft of your visualization

## d. Write an artist statement

My piece shows a graph of my data for each day of the week, color-coded and layered with my school schedule. I was inspired by Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec's Dear Data project, where they visualized personal data in creative and meaningful ways. I liked how their work made the data both informative and visually engaging. The form of my work is a hand-drawn piece using pencil and watercolor, with watercolor used for the bar columns. I created my piece by first drawing the data bars, then layering my weekly class schedule over them to show the relationship between screen time and time spent in class.

# 3. Statistical critique

## a. Revisit and summarize

This paper utilizes linear regression as the statistical test.

## b. Visual clarity

The authors visually represented their statistics very clearly. The linear regression model attached displays the proper response and predictor variables on the y- and x-axes, respectively. The figure shows summary statistics by providing the line of best fit along with the individual data points and a 95% confidence interval shaded around the line, which helps show the model’s uncertainty while still letting the reader see the raw data.

## c. Aesthetic clarity 

The authors handled visual clutter well. The individual dots as data points are small but still easy to see. The line of best fit is a good thickness (not too bold) and the 95% confidence interval is a transparent grey that blends well with the background, so it doesn’t overwhelm the reader or distract from the actual data.

## d. Recommendations

One recommendation I would make is to change the background color of the plot from grey to white to make the data points and confidence interval stand out more. I would also consider changing the color of the regression line to red other than blue to make it more visible and contrast better with the dots. Lastly, I would increase the size of the axis labels slightly and bold them so they're easier to read. These changes would make the figure easier to understand at a quick glance.
